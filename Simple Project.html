    <p style="text-align: justify;">Air and sound pollution is a growing issue these days. It is necessary to monitor air 
        quality and keep it under control for a better future and healthy living for all. Here we 
        propose an air quality as well as sound pollution monitoring system that allows us to 
        monitor and check live air quality as well as sound pollution through IOT. System uses 
        air sensors to sense presence of harmful gases/compounds in the air and constantly 
        transmit this data to microcontroller. Also system keeps measuring sound level and 
        reports it to the online server over IOT. The sensors interact with microcontroller which 
        processes this data and transmits it over internet. This allows authorities to monitor air 
        pollution in different areas and take action against it. Also authorities can keep a watch 
        on the noise pollution near schools, hospitals and no honking areas, and if system 
        detects air quality and noise issues it alerts authorities so they can take measures to 
        control the issue
